<!--
Example:
	My logo.png is 1462 x 655 pixels.
	Since this is too large for my needs, I manually scale it down.
	
	Original image dimenstions: 1462 x 655
	Scaled down: 670 x 300
	
	In the lines below, you will find these two values.
	Change them with your own image dimensions.
	
	To get more spacing between the logos, you need to open the file in a graphics editor and add some padding around the logo.
	Save the new file and change the dimensions in the lines below.
